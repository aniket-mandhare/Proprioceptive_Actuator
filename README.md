# Proprioceptive_Actuator
Repo build in progress. Please refer to my [design portfolio](https://github.com/aniket-mandhare/Schvaan/blob/main/Design%20portfolio.pdf) in the meanwhile.

3d-printed actuators used in quadruped Schvaan.
These actuators use generic 8308 BLDC motors to generate torque, Mjbots 4.11 drive boards for control, and 3d printed cycloidal reduction drives for torque augmentation with minimum backlash and maximum backdrivability. 
All custom-designed parts have been manufactured with FDM 3d-printing.
